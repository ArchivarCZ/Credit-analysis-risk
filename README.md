# Credit-analysis-risk

We create a risk evaluation model based on the dataset German credit data. We use exploratory analysis tools to create basic graphs to look for patterns in the data and finally we create five prediction models that we compare in the end. The models used are Logistic regression, kneigbourhs classifier, random forrest classifier, support vector machine and gradient boosting classifier.
